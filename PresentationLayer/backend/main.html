        <h2>Specification</h2>
        
        <h3>Web Architecture</h3>
        Describe here, with a diagram, the components of your web application
        and how they interact. Highlight which parts belong to the application
        layer, data layer or presentation layer. How did you ensure that HTML is
        not rendered server side?

        The Architecture has been tought as a Three Layer Architecture: the Data Layer is composed of the Postgres database managed on Heroku
        and data contained in it are retrieved by the Application Layer that contains the various services and controllers that interact with the 
        APIs. These APIs are used by the Presentation Layer containing html, css and Javascript files used to visualize the static pages and dynamic pages.
        In particular, dynamic pages are generated by using the data retrieved from the DB through the APIs and changing these pages dynamically once these data are retrieved.
        A simple diagram describing the structure of the project is the following:
        <img src=""/>
        
        <h3>API</h3>
        <h4>REST compliance</h4>
        Describe here to what extent did you follow REST principles and what are
        the reasons for which you might have decided to diverge. Note, you must
        not describe the whole API here, just the design decisions.
        
        <h4>OpenAPI Resource models</h4>
        Describe here synthetically, which models you have introduced for
        resources.

        <h3>Data model</h3>
        Describe with an ER diagram the model used in the data layer of your web
        application. How these map to the OpenAPI data model?
        
        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <h3>Tools used</h3>
        Describe here which tools, languages and frameworks did you use for the backend of the application.
        
        <h3>Discussion</h3>
        Describe here:
        - How did you make sure your web application adheres to the provided
        OpenAPI specification? Which method did you use to test all APIs
        endpoints against the expected response?
        - Why do you think your web application adheres to common practices to
        partition a REST-based web application (static assets vs.
        application data)
        - Describe synthetically why and how did you manage session state,
        what are the state change triggering actions (e.g., POST to login
        etc..).
        - Which technology did you use (relational or a no-SQL database) for
        managing the data model?
        ## Other information
        ### Task assignment
        Describe here how development tasks have been subdivided among members
        of the group, e.g.:
        &gt; - Foo worked on front end (80%) and OpenAPI Spec (20% of the time)
        &gt; - Bar worked on ....
        ### Analysis of existing API
        Describe here the research of (full or part of) existing APIs that are similar
        in objectives and scope to the one implemented, that have possibly guided
        implementation choices (these should not be necessarily OpenAPI
        implementations). Toy APIs (such as the Swagger's Pet Store) or the example
        shown during lectures are not a valid response.
        Use TWO or more items of the form:
        &gt; We took (full/partial) inspiration from API &lt;XYZ&gt;(link) for the part of the
        &gt; API that manages &lt;ABC&gt; because of &lt;REASON&gt;.
        Or
        &gt; For the part of the API that manages &lt;ABC&gt; we considered/studied &lt;XYZ&gt;(link)
        &gt; because of &lt;REASON&gt; but wasn't completely fitting to our purpose because of
        &gt; &lt;REASON&gt;.
        ### Learning outcome
        What was the most important thing all the members have learned while
        6
        developing this part of the project, what questions remained unanswered,
        how you will use what you've learned in your everyday life?
        Examples:
        - Foo learned to write SQL queries and Javascript but wanted to know
        more about caching, he's probably going to create his own startup
        with what she has learned
        - Bar learned how to deploy on a cloud platform, he would have liked
        to know more about promises for asynchronous code..</code></pre>
