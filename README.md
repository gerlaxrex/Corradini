# Corradini Website 🍃
## (Hypermedia Course A.A. 2019/2020 PoliMi)

This is the website that I designed for the Hypermedia course at Politecnico di Milano in 2020.
In general the website is quite simple, but is was a good exercise both for the coding of the front-end part and the in depth study of Bootstrap, and also for the learning of Node.js and OpenAPI.

The website is dedicated to a **fake** volunteering association that is involved in the integration and sustain of young people affected by the Autism Spectre Disorder through a __Common Garden__ planted and cultivated by these young men and women and a __Shop__ where they can sell the products of the nature.

There were some requirements about the design of the website and so I respected them fully, trying to give the website a clear structure without many intertwined links.

## Front-end 🌱

The palette that I've chosen for the website is all nature-based: leaf green, soil brown, and a little of purple somewhere reminding of the eggplants. I decided however to give an important space to white in order to make the user eye rest through all the time that He/She spents on the website.
